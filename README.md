The basic idea for this is to set up a hub and client.

Clients will first connect to the hub and provide some basic info, (username etc) then obtain a list of other available clients.

The available clients will be displayed in a list which the user can attempt to connect. after connecting to a client the users should be able to send data back and forth.
